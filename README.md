In `index.js`, write functions that do the following:

1. Print all the songs
2. Print all the movies
3. Return an array of all Beyonce's hit song titles
4. Return an array of all Beyonce's fierceness ratings

6. Return an array with all of the songs where Beyonce's fierceness is greater than or equal to a given number
7. Return an array with all of the movies Beyonce made in 2006 and after
8. Return all the hit songs where Beyonce was in a group
9. Return a hit song where Beyonce's hair is blonde
10. Return the hit song "Sorry"
11. Return a given song

13. Return the sum of Beyonce's fierceness value for all of her hit songs

21. Return an object with Beyonce's hairstyles as the keys and a tally of each hairstyle, eg. `{ "blonde": 3, ... }`

Note that you can and should reuse your functions and you can write more functions to further break up your work.

You can test your functions by calling them at the bottom of the file and running `node index.js`.
